# get_next_line Project Documentation
Streamlined text retrieval for efficient data handling.

## Introduction
The "get_next_line" function is a custom function implemented in C, designed to read a line from a file descriptor. It is a highly useful utility function for reading text files line by line, especially when dealing with large files or streams of data.

In C programming, the standard library provides functions like `fgets()` and `getline()` for reading lines from files. However, these functions have limitations, such as fixed buffer sizes or inability to handle file descriptors other than standard input. The "get_next_line" function overcomes these limitations by dynamically allocating memory and efficiently handling file descriptors.

The primary goal of the "get_next_line" project is to provide a robust and efficient solution for reading lines from files in C programs. This function is commonly used in projects where parsing or processing of text files is required, such as text editors, compilers, and data processing applications.

Through this project, users can gain a deeper understanding of file I/O operations in C and learn how to implement custom file reading functions to suit their specific requirements.

## Execution
### Cloning the Repository

To use the "get_next_line" function in your project, clone the repository containing the necessary files from GitHub:

```bash
git clone <https://github.com/dansylvain/42_get_next_line.git>
```
### Compiling Your Program
Navigate to the project directory and compile your program, ensuring that you link the "get_next_line" function with your source code:
```bash
cd get_next_line
gcc -o get_next_line.c get_next_line_utils.c
```
or for the bonus version:
```bash
cd get_next_line
gcc -o get_next_line_bonus.c get_next_line_utils_bonus.c
```
## Dependencies
My implementation of the "get_next_line" project includes all necessary dependencies within the source code, requiring no additional installations.

## Using the Function
Once compiled successfully, you can use the "get_next_line" function in your program to read lines from file descriptors. Ensure that you include the necessary header file in your source code:
```bash
#include "get_next_line.h"
```
Now you can use the "get_next_line" function in your program as demonstrated in the previous example.

## Examples: Reading Lines from a File
This example demonstrates how to use the "get_next_line" function to read lines from a file and print them to the console.
```c
#include <stdio.h>
#include "get_next_line.h"

int main() {
    int fd;
    char *line;

    // Open the file descriptor
    fd = open("example.txt", O_RDONLY);

    // Read lines from the file descriptor until EOF is reached
    while (get_next_line(fd, &line) > 0) {
        printf("%s\n", line);
        free(line);
    }

    // Close the file descriptor
    close(fd);

    return 0;
}
```
This example demonstrates how to use the "get_next_line" function to read lines from a file and print them to the console.
